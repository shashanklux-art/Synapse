# Synapse Project

## Overview
This is a GitHub import from https://github.com/shashanklux-art/Synapse.

**Status**: The original repository was empty, containing only a README.md file. A basic Python placeholder has been added to make the project runnable.

## Project State
- **Imported on**: October 04, 2025
- **Original repository contents**: Only README.md with title "# Synapse"
- **Setup completed**: Python 3.11 installed with a placeholder main.py file
- **Workflow**: Console application running main.py

## Current Structure
- `README.md` - Original project title
- `main.py` - Placeholder Python script that prints a welcome message
- `.gitignore` - Python-specific ignore patterns

## Next Steps
The user can now add their actual application code to replace the placeholder main.py file.
